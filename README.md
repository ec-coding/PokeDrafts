## Optimizations

- I plan to implement the following features over time:
  - Allow users to manage more than one deck.
  - Allow users to toggle their decks as public or private.
  - If a deck is made public, allow other users to view them.
  - Render a limited number of files initially, and have the carousel render more as it goes on.
  - Provide an option for users to sort the deck in various ways.
  - Enable more avenues of authentication
  - Show how much of each card is in a deck.
  - When a user is typing in the name of a card, have the search bar offer suggestions.
  - Highlight the button of whichever tab is active.
  - No more than 4 of each card can be added to a deck, with the exception of energy cards.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this app has allowed me to learn and exercise a variety of different coding paradigms, such as MVC architecture, Google authentication, and CRUD operations.
