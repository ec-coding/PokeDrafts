## Optimizations

- I plan to implement the following features over time:
  - Allow users to manage more than one deck.
  - Allow users to toggle their decks as public or private.
  - If a deck is made public, allow other users to view them.
  - Render a limited number of files initially, and have the carousel render more as it goes on.
  - Provide an option for users to sort the deck in various ways.
  - Enable more avenues of authentication
  - Show how much of each card is in a deck.
  - When a user is typing in the name of a card, have the search bar offer suggestions.
  - Highlight the button of whichever tab is active.
  - No more than 4 of each card can be added to a deck, with the exception of energy cards.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this app has allowed me to learn and exercise a variety of different coding paradigms, such as MVC architecture, Google authentication, and CRUD operations.

## Completed Goals:

- The following features have been sucessfully implemented in the app:
  - Utilize MVC architecture to organize all server-side code.
  - Enable Google Authentication for user logins.
  - Ensure that each user has access to their own individual deck.
  - Arrange the user's deck as an object on MongoDB.
  - Successfully deploy app on Heroku.
  - Establish dynamic carousels to accommodate all card results.
  - Create tab views for Search, Search Results, and Deck.
  - When a user deletes a card, remove the slide it is on as well.
  - When the user hits the submit button on Card Search, switch the tab to Search Results.
  - Add radio inputs for Pokemon Type and Card Type.
  - Add checkbox inputs for Card Set.
  - Add a card counter on the Deck panel.
  - A completed deck must have exactly 60 cards.
  - A deck cannot exceed 60 cards.
  - How do you add information from an API's dataset to your own database?
  - How do you connect a user's ID to a card they added into the database?
  - How can I remove a user's entire deck without affecting the cards in another user's deck?
